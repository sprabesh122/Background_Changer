        No way, suicide should never be your rarest of the rare option to get rid of your problems or trauma. The person may be
        going through very different kinds of mental problems, trauma, etc which I cannot express or even think about what he or
        she may be going through but Suicide should never be a solution for you. During coronavirus pandemic, suicide cases are
        almost doubling.
        If the person thinks he or she can commit suicide and after that everything will be normal then let me say you, "You
        have very very wrong thinking." Suicide never makes things simpler rather it makes it more complex. After the suicide,
        you may die and get rid of your life but you leave a lot of problems and regrets back for those people who even believe
        that if they are responsible for your situation. It always makes them regret and responsible for your suicide. If you
        commit suicide then your family breaks down, they start blaming themselves and responsible for the step you've taken.
        
        In the present situation where the world is facing a pandemic coronavirus because of which many migrant workers have
        become homeless, jobless. The daily wages worker don't have anything to eat during this pandemic and they are starving
        their children are starving, the whole family is starving which is very disturbing to watch. Because people have become
        jobless, homeless and they start thinking that they don't have any further role to play and they start thinking of
        "suicide" as an option to get rid of these problems. They think after suicide they will not have to starve or fight for
        the food to eat but that not the right solution to the problem. In some of the cases, the whole family commits suicide.
        I can't tell what these people may be going through but you should never let the thought of "suicide" strike your brain
        even in your nightmares. I am not trying to say that committing suicide is coward act. It requires a lot of courage to
        attempt it or to even have thought of attempting suicide.
        
        Not even in a pandemic but also when life is normal peoples generally young and adult people commit suicide of simple
        reasons are like: Not getting to play pubg, exams, TikTok. I mean committing suicide because your parents not letting
        you play pubg is the dumbest reason I have ever heard. If a child is playing pubg or other games 24*7 then not only your
        parents, anyone will not let you play.
        
        Recently, I heard a student who got 1st rank in his district in class 10 but he could not clear the entrance of Class
        11, and then he committed suicide because he thought that people of his district will scold and not accept him back. I
        mean people have to face and excel in the exam and they believe they can't do well in the exam, they commit suicide. Not
        everyone is Einstein, newton, or Hawking, some of them are also Ronaldo, Michael Jordan, Sachin, MSD, etc. So If you are
        not good at studies then you may be good at singing, sports, dancing, etc. So if you are not good at studies then you
        may be good at sports or you may not be good at sports but good at studies. Just because you are failing at something
        doesn't mean that you are a loser and you cannot do anything further in your life.
        
        So you should never breakdown yourself just because you failed at something or something is not happening in your favor.
        As it is said that "everything will happen when it has to be". So you must have patience and remain calm and keep trying
        until it happens. Before you think of suicide just think about your dad and mom, your family who always wanted you to
        succeed. Suicide will destroy their whole life. They become hopeless and helpless and can never remain happy. You are
        leaving only sadness behind for your family and friends. Suicide not gets you rid of your problems but it destroys your
        close ones which you would never like to see happen.
        
        So I believe you should build yourself, make yourself strong enough to face and tackle every problem not only your but
        your family problems too. Always stay positive. "Empty mind is devil's workshop", so never let your confidence come down
        and always make yourself busy at something. If you don't find anything productive to work with then keep yourself busy
        doing stupid works but keep your brain working at something so that negative thoughts and negativity is far far far away
        from you.
        
        Different people have different opinions regarding suicide and would love to hear your side too. Comment and share your
        opinions. Share with your friends also if you think this can be useful to them or anyone else.
